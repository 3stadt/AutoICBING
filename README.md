# Purpose

Automatically open lootboxes in the [game](http://store.steampowered.com/app/733990/I_Cant_Believe_Its_Not_Gambling/) `I can't believe it's not gambling` Version 5.6

Mainly because there is an "open 100000 loot boxes" achievement and nobody got time for that.

# Where to download?

Use the ahk script or download a compiled exe from [release page](https://github.com/3stadt/AutoICBING/releases/).

# What?

- It's an [autohotkey](https://autohotkey.com/) script, also available as exe.
- It has a self explanatory gui

# How?

- You either start the exe or the ahk script if autohotkey is installed
- You start the [game](http://store.steampowered.com/app/733990/I_Cant_Believe_Its_Not_Gambling/). Windowed, resolution set to either 1600x900 or 1360x768.
- You set a number of boxes to open.
- You press "Run"
- You wait
- You regret the high number of boxes, because your mouse is now in use but you want to rant on some forum.
- You press `Ctrl+Shit+F12` to cancel the openings. Current opening will finish, then your mouse will be free.

If you select to keep loot you may run out of money. Don't do that. You have been warned.

# License

Use at your own risk.

I don't care what you do with the script and I'm in no way liable for anything.

If you do stupid stuff and delete stuff by accident or the script sends your "pictures of kittens" to the wrong person because of a bug or because you could not keep your hands off your mouse it's not my fault.
